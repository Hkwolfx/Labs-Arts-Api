# Labs-Arts-Api

To Clone and run localy :

-> clone the repo in any folder of yours, open two terminals. With the first go to frontend folder and type npm run dev With the second go to backend folder and type npm start

It will run the entire project without the protected files. You can run here any modifications on the front and save it.

Give me a pull request for any improvement, any contributions is appreciated.

For the " npm install <> " packages. Refers to package.json in both frontend and backend folders and npm install the entire list.
